# Side by Side

I needed a fast way to take hundreds of before/after real estate images and put them side by side for comparison.

Nothing seemed to exist, so I wrote something with Python 3 and Pillow.

Before running, you'll need to put your images in a new folder, sort by name, and ensure your pairs are together. Anything after the underscore in a filename will be used as the caption.
